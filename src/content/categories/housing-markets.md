title: 'Housing markets and inequality'
description: 'High-resolution models of housing markets dynamics'
explanation: 'In this research area, I have incrementally developed models of housing markets where the matching between individual households and properties emerges endogenously from fundamental economic behaviour rather than purely data-driven probabilistic approaches. These models are capable of reproducing highly granular empirical facts such as the spatial distribution of property prices and housing affordability. Currently, I am working on a series of policy applications of these models to address crucial questions about the kind of regulations that policymakers and academics conjecture about, but that are difficult to properly assess ex-ante.'
