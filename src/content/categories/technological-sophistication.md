title: 'Technology and production networks'
description: 'Quantify technologies and their interactions'
explanation: 'Technology is central to understand production processes. This research area studies technology and its sole in production networks from different perspectives. A part of this work develops data-driven methods to measure how sophisticated technologies are. Another part builds models where technological sophistication takes a functional form that is embedded in production networks. This is a growing work stream so more publications will be posted soon.'
