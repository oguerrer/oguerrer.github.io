title: 'Expenditure data mapping'
description: 'Mapping government expenditure into outcomes data'
explanation: 'Impact evaluation is one of the most widespread practices in quantitative social sciences. Invariably, it requires data on interventions and outcomes. Despite its generalised adoption, impact evaluation is limited to a reduced number of policy domains where data are available. Ironically, in many countries, there exist government expenditure data across thousands of policies that are not linked to relevant outcome variables. Manually mapping expenditure into indicators can be prohibitively expensive to many governments, severely limiting their ability to integrate impact evaluation in the policy cycle. This research investigates different computational approaches to alleviate the expenditure-outcome linkage problem by provideing automated mapping tools.'
