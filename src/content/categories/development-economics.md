title: 'Economic and sustainable development'
description: 'Government expenditure as a driver of development'
explanation: 'Most of this research area covers the programme of research called Policy Priority Inference (PPI). This work focuses on the importance of government expenditure as a driving force of development. While growing this work stream, we have studied various critical problems of development, such as aid effectiveness, the role of public governance, the quantification of policy coherence, policy resilience, financing subnational development, and achieving equitable health outcomes. Much of this work has been accompanied by policy projects in collaboration with organisations such as the United Nations Development Programme and the World Bank. In addition, the PPI toolkit has been used by national and subnational governments around the world. If you wish to learn more about the policy side of this research area and the analytic tools it has produced, please visit the official PPI website at https://policypriority.org.'
