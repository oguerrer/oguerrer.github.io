title: 'Labour dynamics'
description: 'Studies of fine grained mobility patterns of workers'
explanation: 'I have been developing this research area since my PhD studies. Back then, I proposed the analysis of labour mobility through what I called Labour Flow Networks (LFNs). LFNs have become a common tool to study movements between jobs, firms, industries, occupations, and regions. While most people working in this domain use LFNs as a fixed structure of the labour market (including my earlier studies), I am currently working on models that emerge these complex structures endogenously from economic behavious. These models are extremely useful to study longitudinal dynamics that are impossible to observe in surveys. Therefore, the UK Department for Business and Trade adopted them and deploys them on a regular basis to produce forecasts and counterfactuals on various economic problems.'
