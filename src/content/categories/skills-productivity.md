title: 'Skills and productivity'
description: 'Methods to quantify skills complementarity'
explanation: 'One of the big challenges in fleshing out the underlying mechanisms of productivity is measuring how different skills come together to produce more, i.e. their complementarity. This research area develops models that are explicit about the relationship between skills and the production technology of firms. Currentlyt, you can read my work on how we estimate the wage fraction that is due to complementarities (as opposed to their individual contributions). This is an active work stream so more publications will be posted soon.'
